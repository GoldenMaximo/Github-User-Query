# Concrete Front-End Challenge
> A client-side application that queries the GitHub API and shows the repositories of a particular user.


## Installation

*Make sure to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 10.0.0 (or higher) installed.*

1. Clone it or fork it.

2. Once you have your local copy, install its dependencies using either Yarn:

```
yarn
```

or npm:

```
npm install
```


## Running

After installed, you can start the application by running it with Yarn:

```
yarn start
```

or npm:

```
npm run start
```

*This will start the server at `localhost:3000` (if you didn't change the `PORT` property on `.env`)*
